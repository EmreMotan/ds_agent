Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Reviewed the analysis goal and determined that we need to identify NBA players since 1990 with the longest careers by seasons played, and then explore common characteristics (position, height, draft year, etc.). We must exclude the erroneous entries for 'Andrew Gaze' and 'Ernie Barrett'.
2. Noted that the provided Top-20 table contains career metrics and characteristics for each player – many players have career lengths close to 19–21 seasons with a corresponding season experience. Most players are forwards and guards, with a fair few early draft picks (mostly round 1). There are also interesting outliers such as Udonis Haslem (undrafted) and players with dual position roles.
3. Analyzed the provided charts which include distributions for positions, career length, season experience, weight, and the starting/ending years. These visualizations reveal that the longevity group is distinct from the overall NBA population – they tend to have stable physical characteristics (e.g., tall and robust builds) and typically enter the league in the mid- to late-1990s.
4. Synthesized key insights including the patterns observed in position frequency and draft characteristics, and juxtaposed these findings against the overall population. Hypotheses for observed patterns include the idea that players with strong physical attributes and those drafted in early rounds may better withstand the rigors of long-term play, while role versatility (as seen with players such as Joe Johnson or Jason Kidd) may also aid career longevity.
5. Based on the trends and hypothesis, drafted actionable recommendations focusing on further exploring the benefits of early draft positioning and physical readiness in predicting long careers.
